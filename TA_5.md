## FIN 332: TA 5

#### Execute the following spread trades in your IB account, and upload a summary of your trades to the dropbox on Blackboard (indicating your IB account name and number).  You may implement the spread trades **on any stock you wish**.  You may want to limit yourself to very actively traded stocks---which makes it more likely that the option's are also actively traded.  **Pick a different stock for each trade.**  Otherwise it will be very hard to see your spreads by looking at your trade summary.

For each spread trade the summary should include:

1.  The option symbols, type, strike price, and maturity.

2.  The execution (fill) price of each option, and time (if applicable).

3.  The spread's max gain and loss, and the stock price(s) at which the spread breaks-even.

**You must turn in a spreadsheet which calculated max gain, max loss, and the break-even point for the following spreads**

#### Spread:

1.  **Covered Call**

2.  **Protective Put**

3.  **Collar**

4.  **Straddle**

<!---5.  **Bull Call Spread**-->
